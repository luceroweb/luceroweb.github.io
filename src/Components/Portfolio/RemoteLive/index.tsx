          The first iteration of a simple yet feature-rich page to display the
          revolutionary "Remote Live" technology. When connected to the audio
          feed, live performances are reproduced on the user's Disklavier. We
          are using similar functionality on the Junior Original Concert (annual
          event) and{" "}

            Created a ASP/jQuery event schedule to automate the Flash/HMTL5

          The second itteration of an engaging user experience where consumers
          can connect their Yamaha Disklavier's to our service which allows them
          to enjoy live performances reproduced in synch with our streaming
          video to the Yamaha Disklavier in their own living room.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This site contains an events engine that stores and displays our
            live performance and rebroadcast schedule
          </li>
          <li>
            I constructed the first version of this site myself using simple ASP
            arrays and functions. That site provided the basis for the current
            version which our team here at Yamaha constructed in .NET along with
            my HTML/CSS/jQuery assistance.
          </li>
          <li>
            The final jQuery scripts we wrote update the events list in real
            time
          </li>
          <li>
            Just prior to a performance, the jquery invites the viewer to join
            the broadcast
          </li>
          <li>
            Broadcasts are currently presented in Flash video format only
            (restriction of our 3rd party streaming service) Since our jQuery
            regularly polls the database for changes, we can update event data
            in real time without requiring the user to reload the page.
          </li>
          <li>
            We are recently redesigning this site to incorporate On Demand video
            and streamlined connection instructions, intro video, etc.
          </li>
