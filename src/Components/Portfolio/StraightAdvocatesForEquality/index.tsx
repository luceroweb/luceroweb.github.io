              <strong>Side 1:</strong> The Straight Advocates For Equality
              (SAFE) web site was constructed using the WordPress CMS. It
              features a blog, calendar and featured category on their home page
              that the clients can fully manage and customize.

          A non-profit organization was formed and needs to get a web presence
          up and running before an important event scheduled to occur in Fresno.
          They hope to manage the site themselves with only basic understanding
          of blogging and email usage.
